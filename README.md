Collection of Presets for EARS EQ Chrome extension
Download the extension from here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ears-bass-boost-eq-any-au/nfdfiepdkbnoanddpianalelglmfooik/support?hl=en

In my opinion, this is one awesome extension and provides a good control over various DSP parameters which one can leverage to enhance the audio listening experience.

## Concat Script
Install nodejs and run the following command to get the concatenated presets present in the `presets`
directory

```
npm run concat
```

Paste the one liner JSON into the PRESETS key in local storage for the Chrome extension and you should see the presets show up.
